# scRNAseq_PTC
The code for analyzing the single cell sequencing data (10X Genomics) of papillary thyroid cancer.

1. Data pre-processing and integration.
2. The procedures to load the MNN corrected dataset into the Seurat object.
3. The identification of each distinct cell type.
4. The algorithms implemented (KNN + Spearman's correlation) to discriminate between the tumor and normal thyrid epithelial cells.
5. The code used to perform the trajectory analysis of the thyroid epithelial cells using Monocle2.
